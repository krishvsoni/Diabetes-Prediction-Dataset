# Diabetes-Prediction-Dataset


This repository contains my journey and projects in the field of machine learning.

## Today's Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors and Diabetes Prediction

- Explored the concept of K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in machine learning.
- Implemented KNN in a Python notebook for diabetes prediction.
- Utilized the Euclidean distance metric to measure proximity between data points.
- Excited to continue refining the model and contribute to the healthcare field.

## Repository Contents

- `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`: Python notebook showcasing the implementation of KNN for diabetes prediction.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the repository and documenting the learning journey.

## Future Plans

- Explore different distance metrics in KNN algorithm.
- Experiment with different values of K and analyze their impact on prediction accuracy.
- Apply KNN to other real-world datasets for classification and regression tasks.
